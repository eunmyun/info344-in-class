//Package main is used for your program's main() function,
//plus any other code you want to include in the main package.
//All types, functions, and globals in a package are visible
//throughout the package, but only exported identifiers
//to code in other packages. To export something, make its
//name start with a capital letter (I know, it's kind of goofy
//but that's just the way Go works).
package main

//If you want to use functions or types defined in other
//packages, you need to import them. For standard library
//packages, you just use the package name here. After you
//import the package, you can refer to things in the package
//by using the package name like an object that exposes all
//of its exported types and functions as properties and
//methods of that object. See below for examples.

//helloHandler handles requests made to the /hello path.

//and status codes, as well as write the response body.
//The `r` parameter gives you access to all of the request
//information and any content in the request body.
//For more details, see:
// - https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter
// - https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request
//or just put your cursor on the type name of these
